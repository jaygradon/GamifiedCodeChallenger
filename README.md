# Gamified Code Challenger
A Gamified code challenge web application along the lines of a simplified Hacker Rank, developed with an Angular 2 front end, ASP.NET backend and a graphical village within the front end powered by Unity.

 - **Back end:** The Codegleyd backend uses ASP.NET and is located in CodegleydAPI.  It can be run with Visual Studio or CLI.
 - **Front end:** The Codegleyd frontend uses Angular 2 and is located in Angular2App.  It can be run with `ng serve` on CLI after runnign `npm install` to install the dependencies. 
 - **Settlement:** The settlement simulation uses unity and can be changed by placing built unity web player (WebGL) binaries in *CodegleydAPI/CodegleydAPI/wwwroot/*.  The source is located at https://github.com/Helen-Zhao/codegleyd-unity.
